### Learning Heuristics for Counting Problems with GNN - Masters Thesis, 2024

*ANYCSP enumerating 2-coloring solution for a 11 x 11 grid graph*

[GitLab](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/supreetshm947/anycsp_enum/)
Built on the foundation of [ANYCSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10227), which addresses Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) as a decision problem, this work extends its application to counting problems in Graph Coloring and Boolean Satisfiability.
The model introduces a novel Graph Representation called the Constraint Value Graph, which represents input CSP problems and processes them through a Recurrent Graph Neural Network sampling a list of solutions.
It is trained through Reinforcement learning on a configurable training distribution that generates random instances.

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
